Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles and methodologies to tghe development, maintenance, testing and evaluation of software. Software engineering is important because it provides a structured approach to building software systems that are reliable efficient and scalable.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1960s to 1970s: Intrduction of Streuctured Programming
The development of structured programming introduced a methodical approach to writing code emphasizing readability, maintainability and modularity.
1980s to 1990s: Emergence of Object-Oriented Programming
OOP introduced concepts such as encaspulation,inheritance and polymorphism.
2000s to Present: Rise of Agile Methodoligies and DevOps
Methodologies like Scrum, Kanban and Extreme Programming emerged as alternatives to traditional waterfall methods.  


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Planning to define the scope, objectives and feasibility of a project.
Requirement Analysis to understand and document what the sofware should do.
Design to paln the structure and components of thge software system.
Implementation to convert design specifiactions into executable code.
Testing to verify the software meets standards and works as intended.
Deployment to make trhe software available to the end user.
Maintenance to keep thye software up to date and functional over time. 


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall method is linear and sequential whereas agile method is iterative and incremental.
Waterfall would be appropriate where project requirements are clear and fixed and the project is short-term with predictable outcomes. Agile method is suitable where there are dynamic and evilving requirements. 


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software developer writes, tests and mintains code that makes up the software system.
Quality Assurance Engineer ensures the software meets the required standards and works as intended.
Project Manager oversees the project from start to finish.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDES offers a suite of tools that speed up coding and reduce errors.
VCS allow collaboration, trackoing of histories.
IDEs: VS Code, Sublime Text, VS Codium.
VCS: Git.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Managing changing requirements. Solution: Agile Methodology.
Ensuring code quality. Solution: code reviews and pair programming.
Collaboration challenges. Solution: collaboration tools.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit Testing involves testing indiviadual modules in isolation to ensure each unit works correctlty. This catches bugs early.
Integration Testing focuses on testing interactions between different modules to ensure they work as expected. This detects interface issues early.
System Testing evaluates the complete and integrated software to ensure it meets specified requirements. This validates end-to-end flow.
Smoke/Sanity Testing is a preliminary test to check the basic functionality of software. This ensures quick verification.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting and optimizing prompts for AI models particularly LLMs. Prompt engineering is essential in maximizing the utility of AI models in various applications.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague prompt: "Write a story."
Clear, specific, concise prompt: "Write a story about a farmer, from Nairobi, who farms onions."
